Clearly there is a problem, so I will need to troubleshoot tomorrow morning to diagnose the exact issue

The good news is that the code is all working fine...

Things to check:
- check text extraction (make separate python file to run it and view output)

- break 02/02/2024 into constituent files

- re-run extraction_code.py on split files

- adapt and run NC code on split 02/02/2024 files

- compare code and output with NC code output

- think about how to improve regex searches/prompts
    - do some digging into prompt engineering

- warning message from pandas ("Pyarrow will become a required dependency of pandas in the next major release of pandas (pandas 3.0),
(to allow more performant data types, such as the Arrow string type, and better interoperability with other libraries)
but was not found to be installed on your system.
If this would cause problems for you,
please provide us feedback at https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/54466")

- "None of PyTorch, TensorFlow >= 2.0, or Flax have been found. Models won't be available and only tokenizers, 
configuration and file/data utilities can be used." <- make sure this warning isn't affecting the output

- review regex searches and implement improvements
